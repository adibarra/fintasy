# Frontend Design
The frontend of this app is responsible for handling all user interaction. It is written using TypeScript and Vue as the framework. It is written as a webapp so that it can be loaded through a browser. This means that the webapp is capable running on any device and hardware that supports running a web browser.

## Why use TypeScript+Vue
The reason JavaScript was chosen to build the frontend was *because* it is JavaScript. Every web browser is capable of running JS code natively. This means that we don't need to worry about writing code and transpiling it to JS afterwards. This reduced overhead and leads to a more reliable application. Instead of using vanilla JS, we decided to use a superset of the language called TypeScript. It adds static typing to JS which is a huge benefit. This allows us to catch a lot of bugs at compile time instead of runtime. This leads to a more reliable application.

Vue was chosen as the framework for the frontend because it is a very lightweight framework that is easy to learn and use. It also has a very large community and a lot of support. It is also supported by fantastic tooling like vite and vite-ssg. These allow us to hot-reload the app during development and statically build the app for production with ease. In addition, there is also a plethora of vue component libraries that we can pull from. This allows us to build the app faster and with less code.
