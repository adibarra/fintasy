# API Design
The API is designed as a RESTful API. This means that it will be stateless and will use HTTP methods to interact with the backend. It is responsible for handling all frontend to backend interactions.

## Documentation
The documentation for the API can be found in the [swagger.yaml](../assets/swagger.yaml) file in the `/docs` directory.

You can view the documentation by opening the file in the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) or by running the project locally and navigating to the `/docs/swagger` endpoint.
