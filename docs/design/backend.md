## Project Structure
The backend can be found at `packages/server/`. It is organized into a few primary directories:
- `src/` - contains all the source code
- `public/` - contains all the static files

### `src/`
The `src/` directory is where all the source code for the backend is stored. It is organized into a few subdirectories:
- `routes/` - contains all the routes for the API
- `services/` - contains all the services for the API

### `public/`
The `public/` directory is where all the static files are stored. This includes images and other assets that are served by the backend.
